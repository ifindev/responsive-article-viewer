# Responsive Article Viewer

This is the first static web page I made without following any online/offline video tutorials. Everything purely came up from my mind with the help of Mozilla MDN Docs and Javascript code from Brad Traversy [Netflix Clone Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7t13SGytRk&t=81s) which I did several weeks ago. 

In the beginning of the project, I was really just curious about the `onclick` event handling in Javascript. Then I tried the [example from MDN site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onclick). Then everything just started coming together. All the HTML & CSS I have learned in the past few weeks from the [Internetting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/) materials are starting to become intuitive for me. 

Anyway, I haven't really learned Javascript formally yet, but I have a strong programming background from C, C++, and Python programming. So with the docs and the help of the code from Brad's Netflix clone project, I managed to build a very simple site which is responsive and also can handle a simple click event and DOM manipulation. 

This is just the beginning, trust me!

Thanks for stopping by :).
